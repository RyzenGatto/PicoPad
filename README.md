# Notes
The ultimate end goal of this is to be able to control everything in my room with a singe, detachable keypad (meaning battery support will be coming soon)

There is still much to do and this is currently untested, but feel free to modify it in anyway you'd like (within the licance)

# To do List
Add a Smart Switch for my lights

Add rechargeable battery

Create a 3D printed case
